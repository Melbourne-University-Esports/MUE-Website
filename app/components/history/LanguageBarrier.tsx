                Many Chinese students were also avid gamers of e-sports back home, but because they came to Melbourne 'to study and not to play', a lot of potential e-sport pros chose to suppress
                their talents in favour of a degree. A group of Chinese students saw it problematic that there has never been a proper platform in Unimelb for e-sports, and sought to dispel an 
                old Chinese stereotype that an avid gamer makes a failure in society. In the first weeks of Semester 2 of 2018, they initiated the club affiliation process under UMSU to found a club, 
                to be named the E-Sports Association, and all was smooth in the beginning.

                However, in the midst of discussions they immediately recognised a challenge at hand: being a university club promoting esports, a global phenomenon, meant that they couldn't treat this
                club as a Chinese-only club where members primarily communicate in Mandarin. The club needs to appeal to the local English-speaking community too, and with what they had thus far planned
                for the club they risked alienating this very vital community.

                To their luck, they were by chance contacted by MU Sports that another team seeks also to found an e-sports club. Under UMSU rules, where two teams intend to found clubs that bear similar 
                aims, those two teams are to merge into a single club. And it was exactly through this that they met with the team from SEE. It was a match made in heaven - with the same wish of seeing the
                e-sport scene in Unimelb grow, within days both teams were able to sort things out and initiate future plans for the club.
