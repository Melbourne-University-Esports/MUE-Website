                E-Sports in Unimelb before UMESA
            </h6>       
            <p className="text-white font-light leading-relaxed">
                Before UMESA was founded, there was another club that managed Unimelb&apos;s e-sport affairs - the Society for Electronic Entertainment (SEE). 
                SEE is a club that has always focused on generic gaming, whether it be on PC or on the consoles. In general, they have no specific games on which
                they focus - most of its members favour Pokemon, Super Smash Bros and Tekken 7, but technically they chose not to focus on any game - when SEE was 
                founded some ten years ago, they sought to promote the joys of gaming and to encourage members to discuss games and play together to foster relations 
                among themselves. At that time, the term e-sports has yet to even be coined and as such, SEE had members who managed individual communities that played 
                games such as League of Legends, CS:GO and Overwatch.

            </span>
            <span className="text-white font-light leading-relaxed">
                Gradually as the e-sport market and tournament scenes exploded all around the world, SEE found that it could no longer endeavour to focus on e-sports while 
                still trying to manage the other genres of gaming. Eventually, SEE&apos;s committee of 2017 sought to lead efforts to found a separate e-sports club in Unimelb.
                However, at that time, UMSU saw no reason to found a separate club with a constitution they deemed too similar to that of SEE&apos;s. With this failure, SEE sought
                to rejuvenate their efforts in promoting e-sports, enacting plans for the individual communities to host weekly online sessions to keep the community together, 
                and hosting tournaments that could potentially engage the e-sport gamers.

            <span className="text-white font-light leading-relaxed">
                This did not last, however, as the committee of 2018 found it increasingly harder to simultaneously promote gaming and e-sports. The tournaments did not gain as much
                traction as they had hoped, and the communities gradually died off as one by one their administrators and members moved on with their lives, and with no successors to
                rally these communities back to the weekly games. Hence, the committee sought again to found a separate e-sports club. Seeking advice from the team that led the first attempt,
                this time they decided that the club would be founded under MU Sports.

            <span className="text-white font-light leading-relaxed">
                It was during negotiations with MU Sports that this team would find out about another separate team that had already initiated the founding of the club under UMSU. This club was 
                to be named the University of Melbourne E-Sports Association.
